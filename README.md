# GlitchSMP
Current and past addon packs for the Glitch SMP. Also contains some old texture packs from our events. Can be used according to the Minecraft Bedrock Addon documentation, as folders or zip compressions. 

They have been tested and are only developed for Minecraft Education (stable), currently Bedrock 1.18.65 and are expected but not guaranteed to perform on any new or same version of Education or mainstream Bedrock Edition.

Free use for those of honorable intentions. I request but do not demand credit for my subpar development.
